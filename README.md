# JaqueWalker
The goal of this project is to Sync the Pokewalker to a 3DS in an attempt to recreate Dimitry's PalmOS app. 

This is my 3rd try at this. I'm forking fitmetersync as their code was nicer and did a spectacular job capturing packets.

# Disclaimer
I'm really sorry for the spaguetti code, bad practices and other kind of programming horrors.

Also I'm obviously and blattantly copying code from Dimitry, HenkKalkwater, mrbob312 and everyone available. Thanks all. 


# Documentation gathered from
* [This page on iFixit telling the Wii Fit Meter uses IrDA](https://www.ifixit.com/Answers/View/205720/Fit+Meter+IR+emitter+freq#answer205742). This was the spark that leaded me to write this project.
* [The contributers to this project](https://github.com/RedInquisitive/3DS-Remote), because I lost a lot of hope until I encountered that project.
* [This guy who is reverse engineering the Pokewalker, which seems to be similar to the Wii Fit Meter](https://gbatemp.net/threads/pokewalker-hacking.419462/)
* The [3DBREW page about IR](https://www.3dbrew.org/wiki/IR_Services)

(deosamox) I'll add more documentation I swear...
